"Tabular Method" is a method in Digital Logic through which you can calculate the min. form of a boolean algebra equation, the app also shows its steps. Runnable JAR available.

for example lets say a 4 bits kmap. 16 minterms
enter number of minterms as number (0~15)
it will calculate the minterms and print it alphabetically in the form "A'B'C' + A'B + AD"
